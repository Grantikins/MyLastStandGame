This is a small game made by me, Grant Randell. It's sort of a recreation of a popular flash game from my childhood called the Last Stand.
However, this one is in a completely different setting than the original which was a zombie game. This was developed using python and pygame. I used python 3.10.2 and
pygame 2.1.2. There is a chance that if you use later versions of pygame, that this game will not work. 

To check pygame version, open a terminal and type: "py -m pip show pygame"
To play, open a terminal, cd to the directory with the files in it, and type: "py main.py"
